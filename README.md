## Project Overview

The Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis project aims to analyze the effectiveness of a bank marketing campaign using classification models. The goal is to analyze and predict the customer responses to a bank's marketing campaigns and help the bank to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and enhance campaign effectiveness based on these insights.

## DataSet Overview

The [bank marketing campaign dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing) used in this project is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository, The dataset downloaded from the website has four datasets:
There are four datasets: 
1) bank-additional-full.csv - with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
2) bank-additional.csv  - with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.
3) bank-full.csv - with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 
4) bank.csv - with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 

This project is modelled using the [bank-additional-full.csv](Resources/bank-additional-full.csv) file from the Resources folder and has 41,188 records with the following features:
